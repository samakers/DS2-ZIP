# DS2-ZIP

This is a small program I created for my workplace to increase effiency.

The program takes a file path that contains .DS2 files (encrypted dictation), a four digit Winscribe Author ID, a Winscribe Job Type, generates a .WST file (metadata file) with this data so that our converter service can pick this up, generate a .WAV file and process the file through to secretarial staff for transcription.  

This program is only required when an author does not program their device with an author code, or does not select an author code.
